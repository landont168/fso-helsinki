## Part 1 - Introduction to React

- `components` - independent and reusuable building blocks of a web app
- `props` - arguements passed into components
- `useState` - hook that allows you to add a state variable to a component; to manage and store data that changes over time

## Part 2 - Communicating with server

- `useEffect` - hook that allows you to synchronize a component with an external system (ex. fetch data from server); executed after the initial render
- `promise` - object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asychronous operation (ex. pending, fulfulled, rejected)
